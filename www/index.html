<p>OpenEth is a project designed to enable a crowd-sourced analysis of ethical dilemmas, to enable better decisions based upon available information, and its relative likelihood.</p>

<p>The project is developed under the following design assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To facilitate everyday interactions as well as to help discover paths through ethical quandaries.</p></li>

<li><p>Not to prescribe a specific moral frame, or to elevate one specific principle over all others, rather to find safe zones within which to operate that reasonable people would find it difficult to object to.</p></li>

<li><p>A focus on Kindergarten Ethics (theft, lying, violence, etc) and simple pro-social behaviour over complexities that even humans find challenging, such as trolley problems.</p></li>

<p>The overall goal of this project is to help enable a wide variety of autonomous systems to participate safely within society, through known-good behavioural heuristics that may be supported where necessary by human oversight.</p>

<p>It is also hoped that this project may guide distributed human networks such as peer-to-peer arbitrage systems, or trust and validation networks.</p>

<p>OpenEth is free and open source. We encourage the community to contribute to the codebase, along with sharing insights on ethical analysis.</p>
